Redirects http://projects.trophia.com/influ to http://github.com/trophia/influ

Trophia used to have a [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) server to host our sofware projects. But we have since moved to [Github](https://github.com/trophia) and shutdown that server. This repository simply sets up a HTML redirect from http://projects.trophia.com/influ to http://github.com/trophia/influ so that a link in [this paper](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/fsr174?%0Aijkey=zZGx3RoK1zkxhaL&keytype=ref) remains valid.
